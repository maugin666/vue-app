# vue-app
The app allows you to search TV shows by their name and renders the result in grid layout.

### Author's comments
I decided to create the simplest working solution without big amount of libraries because there is no specific requirements. If would be needed to expand the app, I would like to add state, cache requests, maybe to change `fetch` to `axios` or `swr`, create UI library and themes. Also I would divide components into folders and add test for each component.
